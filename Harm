Despite all the benefits of robots in society, performing dangerous industrial tasks and going to places humans can’t or won’t go, there are still very credible fears about them. The military is increasing reliance on drones and automated robots. Many feel that jobs are being threatened by increasing automation. Now they have something else to worry about: robots that can harm humans on their own.

A roboticist and artist based in Berkeley, California has just created a robot that breaks Asimov’s first rule, “A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.”

Let’s qualify that: robots harm humans all the time. Industrial accidents that involve robots and humans are common and drone strikes certainly kill many. But this one is different: it hurts humans deliberately and even its creator, Alexander Reben, cannot tell whether it will harm someone.

“The decision to hurt a person,” Reben said to The Washington Post, “happens in a way that I can’t predict.” The software does not use machine learning or artificial intelligence to decide but neither is it a 50:50 chance. “I don’t know the probability,” Reben adds.
